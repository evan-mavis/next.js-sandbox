# Next.js Micro Apps Practice 🧑‍🎓

A collection of Next.js micro applications built for practice. Each app is completed within **2 hours** and focuses on specific Next.js features, patterns, and best practices.

## Process

For each micro app, I follow this workflow:

1. **Design Phase**: Create a wireframe and UI mockup using [v0](https://v0.dev) to visualize the app structure and design
2. **Implementation Phase**: Build the app to match the v0 design as closely as possible, implementing all functionality and features

## Getting Started

Each micro app is self-contained. Navigate to the specific app directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
